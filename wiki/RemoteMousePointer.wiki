#Project state

= Introduction =

The project is working nicely, however I need to add some GUI to make it easier on the non-technical crowd.  The program should be available on the Android Market sometime in the future.
There are other two mice for the Android.  However, to my knowledge this is the first one open source.  The server side was release so that I can get comfortable with Google code, the rest of the code will be up soon !
